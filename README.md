# README

This application is a Chat App powered by Rails.

I used Turbo and ActionCable for the instant message loading,
I also used Devise for user authentication and login.

Using this application you can create an account, and link a username / pfp to that account.
After you have signed in, you'll be redirected to the chat rooms where you can create rooms and chat with other people who are online.
